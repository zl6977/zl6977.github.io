I am a postdoc working in [NORCE](https://www.norceresearch.no/en/about-us).
This Github page is mainly to share some troubles I encoutered during progamming, which I still cannot solve easily after reading the other online references.

## What will you be working on?

As a postdoc, I will work to develop a Drilling Data Bot (DDBot) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate semantic modeling of drilling data, aiming to simplify this manual modeling process. 
These semantic models can enhance interoperability between different digital systems. Thus, a plug-and-play environment at drilling sites can be expected.

## What have you worked on before?

During my PhD, I worked with Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) and semantic modeling. Simply speaking, KBE uses an object-oriented approach to explicitly represent design knowledge, particularly product geometry, enabling its reuse. 
Semantic modeling further enhances this representation, improving the interoperability and extendability of software systems. With increased reusability, interoperability, and extendability, higher levels of automation can be achieved in the product design stage.
